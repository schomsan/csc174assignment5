      <h3>Brand and Identity Development</h3>
      <p>I build brands and identities for start-up and small businesses. I also design branded graphic assets, from custom-designed logos to web banners. I'm skilled in designing for various platforms, including most popular social media platforms, prints, and wall decorations.
